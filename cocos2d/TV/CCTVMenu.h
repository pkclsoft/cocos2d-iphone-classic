 *
 *  An example use of this is a potentiometer, used to set the volume of music.  The user would pan to focus the potentiometer

 *  frame (bacause it has focus), and it can then apply actions based on the angle.  For example, you can calculate a point on

/**
 *  A CCMenu subclass that provides a basic, yet functional focus management system for tvOS in Cocos2D.  It supports
 *  the use of CCMenuItem and it's subclasses, plus any objects that conform to the CCFocusableMenuItem protocol.
 *
 *  The menu is intended to provide behaviour similar to that provided by Apple's UIKit focus manager on tvOS in that
 *  menu items require focus to be given to them before they can be activated.
 *
 *  CCTVMenu works by allowing the user to pan from one menu item to another.  There is an internal distance threshold
 *  used to determine at what point in a straight-line pan the focus will move from one menu item to the next.  The 
 *  CCTVMenu uses the direction of the pan to determine which menu item is given focus.  It searches the enabled menu
 *  items for the closest menu item in a straight line within 25.0 degrees of the pan direction.
 *
 *  CCTVMenu also tried to respect Apple's UI Guidelines by using the Apple TV Remote's "menu" button to act as a
 *  trigger for the "back" button on your scene/layer/node.  By setting the backItem property, the CCTVMenu will hide
 *  that item from view, but will activate it if the "menu" button is pressed.  The backItem is also ignored for focus
 *  events.
 *
 *  Another class, CCTVMenuStack is used to manage CCTVMenu instances.  Typically (at least in my apps), I create a
 *  CCMenu instance on each distinct scene/layer that the user is to interact with.  If you use CCTVMenu instead for
 *  each scene, then as the menu is realised (via onEnter), it pushes itself onto the static stack object.  When it
 *  does this, any other CCTVMenu instances are disabled.  When a CCTVMenu is cleaned up (via cleanup), it pops itself
 *  off the stack.  This way the application doesn't need to manage the enabling and disabling of menus (which is needed
 *  if you add a layer to your main game node that has it's own menu) and it all happens smoothly with little or no
 *  change to the existing code.
